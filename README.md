# Welcome and Schedule
Welcome to the Fresh Eyes Challenge. This challenge is all about transforming the way that you see the figure. It's a 10 day challenge, but you can do it at your pace (it doesn't have to be 10 days).

You'll be accessing a variety of tutorials, recordings of live feedback sessions, custom reference images, and this community platform where you can connect to other people who are also taking part in the challenge.

The exercises are designed to be suitable to all abilities, so it doesn’t matter whether you’re a complete beginner or an experienced artist: if you’re interested in improving your life drawing skills, you’re in the right place!

## How does it work?
For each day of the challenge, there is a post containing the exercises and reference images. Some days include tutorials and other guidance. During the first half you'll be working with a 2D model of the figure where you can move and rotate the parts, as well as drawing a lot.

All you need to do is do the exercise each day. There are also recordings of live sessions which provide extra insights and guidance, if you feel you need it.

If you'd like to share your drawings, you can do so in the 'Fresh Eyes Students' area.

I recommend hitting the 'like' button on each post as you complete that day, to help keep track of where you are in the challenge.

## What will we work on each day?
Over the 10 days, there will be 2 main YouTube tutorials, 3-4 extra mini-tutorials, 4 live sessions, and 5 references images to draw each day. As always, I will keep everything as concise and clear as possible. Here's a summary of how the challenge will be structured: 

### Day 1
* YouTube Tutorial: the Fresh Eyes 2D model, approx 15 mins
* Extra explanation mini-tutorial: how to use the 2D model in practice
* Exercise 1: recreating poses with the 2D model for 5 front poses

### Day 2
* Exercise 2: recreating and drawing 5 front view poses with the 2D model
* Recording of the live session, 45  mins - how to see the major forms and ideas in the front poses and addressing common mistakes.

### Day 3
* Extra explanation mini-tutorial: Introducing the side view. 
* Exercise 3: Recreating and drawing 5 side view poses using the 2D model.

### Day 4
* Exercise 4: Further side view practice with 5 poses
* Recording of the live session, 45 mins - understanding the forms in side view and addressing common mistakes.

### Day 5
* Exercise 5: drawing 6 poses in front and side views without the 2D model.

### Day 6
* YouTube Tutorial: Moving to 3D forms, approx 15 mins
* Exercise 6 - drawing 5 simple poses with foreshortened limbs using simple forms and surface lines

### Day 7 
* Exercise 7 - drawing rotated torsos using simple 3D forms for ribcage and pelvis
* recording of the live session, 45 mins - using observations to lay down 3D forms

### Day 8 
* Exercise 8 - drawing twisting torsos using simple 3D forms
* Extra explanation mini-tutorial: how the pelvis, ribcage, shoulders and twist create different twists.

### Day 9
* Exercise 9 - drawing complex ribcage and pelvis relationships with angle difference, tilt difference and rotation difference / twist. At this point, we start to understand the relationships between forms in 3 dimensions at once.

### Day 10 
* Drawing Exercise 9, accompanied with new reference poses
* recording of the live session, 45 mins - the finale live session, where we tackle all sorts of poses using our Fresh Eyes to understand the forms we see.

## When were the live sessions recorded?
The live sessions were recorded in February 2022 when the Fresh Eyes challenge was started. The sessions were a chance to gain extra clarity about the simplified forms we are studying, address common problems that came up in the community area and to answer questions. These live sessions were optional and watching the recordings is not a requirement for you to complete the challenge, but they are there for you to watch at your own pace if you find them useful! 

Thanks everyone, and hope you enjoy the challenge!
